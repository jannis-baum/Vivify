# Vivify

Vivify brings your files to life in the browser! Vivify is primarily made to
render Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, but will also serve as a directory
browser and let you view code files with syntax highlighting. See below for
features!

## Features

- view Markdown with various [features](#markdown-features)
- view Jupyter Notebooks
- view other plain text files with code syntax highlighting
- view & navigate directories, hidden "back to parent directory" button at the
  top-left of the file viewer
- easy to integrate with any editor for live synchronization (see [editor
  support](#editor-support))
- Vivify server starts lazily and automatically shuts down when no more viewers
  are connected
- various [customization options](docs/customization.md)
  
If you need any additional features, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/jannis-baum/vivify/issues/new/choose) or
[contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

  as well as absolute file links

You can find examples for all supported features in the files in the
[`tests/rendering`](tests/rendering) directory. In case you are looking at these
on GitHub, keep in mind that GitHub doesn't support some of the features that
Vivify supports so some things may look off.

### Editor Support

Vivify has a simple API to integrate your favorite editor so the viewer live
updates to any changes as you are typing and the scrolling is smoothly
synchronized!

See below for a list of existing editor plugins. In case your favorite editor is
not yet supported, use these as an example to write your own and add it to the
list!

#### Existing integration

- for Vim and Neovim: [vivify.vim](https://github.com/jannis-baum/vivify.vim)

## Acknowledgments

I have been using
[iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)
for the longest time and started this project because

1. I wanted a Markdown viewer that works with and without Vim and
2. I wanted a Markdown viewer that supports file links like in GitHub.

Looking at
[iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)
helped in development, particularly with regard to which `npm` packages to use.
