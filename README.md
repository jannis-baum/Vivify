# Vivify

Vivify brings your files to life in the browser! Vivify is primarily made to
render Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, but will also serve as a directory
browser and let you view code files with syntax highlighting. See below for
features!

> [!TIP]
> We recently released [Jupyviv](https://github.com/jannis-baum/Jupyviv), a new
> solution for interacting with Jupyter Notebooks from plain text editors like
> Neovim by using Vivify as a live viewer. If you like Vivify and use Jupyter
> Notebooks, make sure to check out the project!

You can find examples for all supported features in the files in the
[`tests/rendering`](tests/rendering) directory. In case you are looking at these
on GitHub, keep in mind that GitHub doesn't support some of the features that
Vivify supports so some things may look off.

### Editor Support

Vivify has a simple API to integrate your favorite editor so the viewer live
updates to any changes as you are typing and the scrolling is smoothly
synchronized!

See below for a list of existing editor plugins. In case your favorite editor is
not yet supported, use these as an example to write your own and add it to the
list!

#### Existing integration

- for Vim and Neovim: [vivify.vim](https://github.com/jannis-baum/vivify.vim)

## Installation

Once you have Vivify installed, use it by running `viv` with any text file or
